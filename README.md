The original SeqXGPT is here, including some documentation: https://github.com/Jihuai-wpy/SeqXGPT/tree/main/SeqXGPT

This repository updates SeqXGPT to a more recent version of python, and relaxes the requirements of the project in order to run. Additionally, I have performed optimizations and refactoring to the backend code in order to make the addition of models to the project easier and more understandable. 

P.S. to use Llama2 you will need your own HF token. That one is not valid.


Have questions about how to build a dataset for this, or why I put this here? Reach out! I may eventually create better documentation for all of this, but this code is essentially been put on a shelf for now. It wasn't as useful as I had hoped in a particular type of text.
