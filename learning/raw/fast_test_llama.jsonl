The Moonglows' first release on the label, a swooning doo-wop ballad called Sincerely, written by Fuqua and co-credited to Freed, and with Lester taking the lead vocal, reached No 1 on the US R&B hit parade in 1954, but the greater success of a cover version by the McGuire Sisters prevented them from rising above No 20 in the pop charts (the original version was later used by Martin Scorsese in his film Goodfellas).

One group kept the name Riksmål as their own unofficial form of Norwegian, and ignored the spelling and grammar changes of the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative forms of Bokmål have been the standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century. After the Bokmål and Riksmål reform, some have chosen not to use any of the two reform languages. These language activists who are called the \"old-timers\" use the historical Samnorsk form of written Norwegian (Nynorsk or Bokmål) and have kept the old grammar order, with the exception of some minor changes, as the spelling and grammar of the two languages were already quite similar. The minor changes consisted of combining the words \"ar\" and \"å\", \"till det\" and \"til det\", and \"med\" and \"mede\". Another form of written Norwegian is more rarely used. Dialectal Norwegian (Dia) is a written language based on a combination of written Norwegian and spoken Norwegian, and it was used by people who spoke dialects and read literary Bokmål or Nynorsk.

{"text": "Philosophers are known to coin thought provoking sayings that leave individuals in awe. One such question that has stood the test of time is “If a tree falls in a lonely forest, but there are no animals around, does it make a sound?” In 1884, the authors of Scientific American answered a different form of this question stating that sound is the perception of vibratory impulses transmitted via air or other media. So although the tree will generate vibration, if there are no ears to perceive it, then there is no sound.\nAnother intriguing question relates to whether or not light is a particle or a wave. The answer is both, and this was first recognized by a Dutch scientist named Frits Zernike in the 1930s. Zernike performed light scattering experiments on a liquid crystal that produced an interference pattern when light passed through it. The presence of an interference pattern is an indication that light is behaving like a wave when passed through the liquid crystal. The next step in his experiment was to pass polarized light through the crystal. Upon observing the interference pattern produced with this light, he had observed light behaving like a particle and not a wave. It is through experimentation that we are able to understand and see how light behaves in different situations.\nOne of the common misconceptions among students is that a lens bends light. In actuality, what a lens does is changes the focal distance that an image forms in. When an image is focused through a lens, it is because the focal point is different from the focal distance. In other words, light travels from the focal point at a certain speed and when a lenses changes the focal point, the image changes. Without these differences, we would simply appear to be floating off to the side when we look at ourselves", "prompt_len": 522, "label": "llama"}
