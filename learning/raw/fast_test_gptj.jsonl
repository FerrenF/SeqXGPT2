It only appears in articles about the Sami language and the national minority in northern Norway. However, it is often used in the Sami language itself.

His life contained a large amount of both great success and horror and one might ask whether his ideas and achievements deserve a place in the pantheon of important figures. His work - although he hated being known as a 'theoretical utilitarist' - remains highly influential. It has changed the face of ethics and, though he himself was concerned with how institutions interact with psychology and other natural sciences, he also had a good idea about how to design the institutions of the world.\n\nOne might ask how much of him should be represented in university.

Mascots act as a significant vehicle for communicating the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially children and youth. They create a close connection between them, the Olympic Games and their host cities.\n\nThe role of Mascots has also increased substantially since the Beijing Olymipics in 2008.

{"text": "Dehydrating does not damage enzymes. Moisture evaporation from food acts as a cooling process and keeps the temperature below the actual air temperature in the dehydrator. In his book Enzyme Nutrition, Dr. Edward Howell explains that because of the difference in food temperature and air temperature, it is safe to dehydrate at settings up to 145 degrees because the temperature of the food will not exceed 118 degrees.\n\nAnother myth is that dehydrating destroys the nutritional value of food. In fact, this is not true. The main food carbohydrates are sugars. Moisture is needed for these to crystallize and the crystallized sugar is the real source of our energy. If food is dried with enough sugars, it is possible to increase food energy, even up to 400 percent more than cooked food. Many people who are allergic or intolerant to some carbohydrate sources should check their food labels to choose products with the least amount of sugars possible. The less sugar, the smaller the calorie and carbohydrate cost.\n\nWhen processing food for long-storage, dehydration is a good way to conserve vitamins such as A, and C. Dehydration also conserves vitamin B-1, B-2, and D when fat is used as a binding medium.\n\nThe amount of moisture needed to deactivate enzymes varies according to the amount of moisture the food has in the first place. Cooking also destroys many enzymes, but to a lesser extent.\n\nFor a dehydrator to be effective for many foods, it must be set at 105 degrees or higher. Water content should be reduced to a point that the food dries evenly. For example, with most vegetables and fruit, it seems to need about a 45 percent moisture content in dry matter.
